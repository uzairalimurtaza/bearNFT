        question : 'What is the lore of Karma Bear?',
        answer:`It is a story of a bear living multiple lives in multiple timelines. Bearing a new name in every life, he gets a revelation and earns wisdom ($WISDM). 
        And when one of those lives is epic, the Karma Bear transcends into a Legendary Karma Bear, with more wisdom ($WISDM) than anyone else. 
        After the Karma Bear has earned enough wisdom, he is ready to take on disciples to distribute his teachings. These Karma Disciples carry the knowledge into the metaverse.
         
        When a Karma bear has lived all the lives and has met all the mentors – UNIVERSE TURTLE, GUARDIAN OWL and THE WOLF OF UNDERSTANDING – he experiences all those lives in one instant – becoming the ALL BEAR.
